Writing On The Wall: Story Prep
</h2>

Hi! And thank you for having a look at this tool I made. It's made as a part of the Writing On The Wall Plug-in I made for Godot. <br>
(link here once the plug-in repo is up!)

<h3 align="center"> What is it and what does it do? </h3>
Story Prep is a website / tool I made using React. It allows you to quickly turn texts into a JSON file. The text is divided up line by line, so you can access each line of text individually. Any and all text will work! <br>
An example of what prepped text looks like can be found in the repository, in the example folder. <br>
https://github.com/dvbeelen/Story_Prep/blob/main/example/Moby%20Dick.json

 <br><br>
 
The returned JSON file can be used to create environmental subtitles using the Writing On The Wall plug-in for Godot (link). More information on how that works can be found in the readme for the plug-in. But you can use Story Prep for your own purposes too of course!

<h3 align="center"> What do I need? </h3>
If you do not have it installed already, you will need NodeJS to run this project. 
Versions 12.18.2 and above will do. <br>
You can download NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en/

<h3 align="center"> How do I start? </h3>
Just as with most projects made with React, you can download the project from this page, open it up in an editor of your choice
and run the following:

`npm install`

and then

`npm run start`

This will open your browser with Story Prep up and running!

<h3 align="center"> How do I get my story / text prepped? </h3>
The process of Story Prep is pretty straightforward. When you open the tool and walk trough the form, you will need to fill in:
<ol>
 <li> The title of your text or story </li>
 <li> The name of the author of your text or story (that could also just be you of course) </li>
 <li> The text you want converted to JSON </li>
 <li> That's it! Now you just click the big blue button and a JSON file with your prepped story in it will be downloaded! </li>
</ol>
