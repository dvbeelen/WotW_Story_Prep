    "0": "Call me Ishmael",
    "1": "Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world",
    "2": "It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation",
    "3": "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can",
    "4": "This is my substitute for pistol and ball",
    "5": "With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship",
    "6": "There is nothing surprising in this",
    "7": "If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me",
    "8": "There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf",
    "9": "Right and left, the streets take you waterward",
    "10": "Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land",
    "11": "Look at the crowds of water-gazers there",
    "12": "Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon",
    "13": "Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward",
    "14": "What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries",
    "15": "Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep",
    "16": "But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks",
    "17": "How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive",
    "18": "Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice",
    "19": "No",
    "20": "They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in",
    "21": "And there they stand—miles of them—leagues",
    "22": "Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west",
    "23": "Yet here they all unite",
    "24": "Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more",
    "25": "Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes",
    "26": "Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream",
    "27": "There is magic in it",
    "28": "Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region",
    "29": "Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor",
    "30": "Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever"
